This Vue.js project is based of a lamp. By clicking the lamp (coloured square), it will turn the lamp on/off.
When on, by dragging the slider, it will change the brightness level in the colour being shown.
In the text field, the colour can be modified by entering a CSS colour value (e.g. red, blue, green etc), which will change the colour displayed on the lamp.
